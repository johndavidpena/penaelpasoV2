        <p>In part 1 on this topic, we explored the idea of millennials and their relationship with homeownership. And while this generation is certainly different than previous ones, the question was asked, 'Are millennials interested in buying homes?' Well, what do millennials themselves say when asked this question?</p>
        <br />
        <p>In one recent survey, 70% of those planning to buy but currently renting, said they can not afford to buy now and 33% said that they are not ready to settle down. 24% of those polled said that they are waiting to find a long term partner before committing to homeownership. This sounds reasonable enough but with money being the deciding factor for most young people that want to buy a home, a recent study found that 48% of millennials have zero money saved for a home purchase, 31% have $1 - $5,000 saved, and a measly 21% have over $5,000 saved.</p>
        <br />

        <br />
        <p>Now, this should not be too surprising and one of the reasons can be attributed to the rising costs of rent in many parts of the country, especially those larger metropolitan areas that many millennials want to live in. Another financial weight for many is student loan debt. This is certainly nothing new other than the fact that the cost of higher education continues to increase.</p>
        <br />
        <p>So, are there any long term ramifications for the millennial generation that seems to be delaying the formation of families and the subsequent purchase of a home? Well, many believe that it will have a significant impact on their ability to build future wealth. They may end up with fewer financial resources to access in retirement. Additionally, wealth created through homeownership normally gets transferred from parents to children, and if that wealth is less, that means that less financial resources will be going to the next generation, making wealth inequality worse. </p>
        <br />
        <p>Now, there is some good news here as well. First time home buyers started out 2020 very strong with the purchase of 456,000 single family homes. That is up 14% from just one year ago. Of course, the health pandemic disrupted the market but by May, it had already started to bounce back. Currently, the housing market has rebounded completely and continues to show strength. </p>

        <br />
        <p>Ultimately, most experts believe that millennials will buy homes and embrace homeownership, BUT there are still plenty of issues to overcome. Namely, building houses at prices that they can afford. Additionally, millennials are going to have to find ways to save money for down payments or get creative when it comes to financing that first home. Of course, some will have the advantage of asking their parents for down payment assistance which may be a small price to pay to get them out of the basement!</p>
        <br />
        <p>And what about the next generation of home buyers, Generation Z? Currently, many of them are still in elementary school but some are old enough to be in college and there's 67 million of them. These young people are on track to be the most highly educated generation ever, they are more likely to grow up in rented homes than owned homes, and they are the most racially and ethnically diverse generation ever. Only time will tell for these young people, but one thing is for sure, home ownership remains a rite of passage for most, whether they get there sooner or later in life.</p>
